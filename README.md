## Purpose

* This repository is for you and the teaching staff only. It should private and not be visible to the world.
* One of your first tasks is to provide staff with read-level access to your repository where this file is stored.
* The unit teaching staff account for bitbucket is ai4g.swin.repos@gmail.com
* Make sure that your account has your real name, and uses your swinburne email address. This allows us to find you and your work easily.
* We have provided a folder structure for the unit tasks. You don't have to use it, but we highly recommend that you do.

## Notes
* Do not share teaching materials provided in this unit online. That include lecture notes, sample code, spike documents, as well as your own work that could be inappropriately used by someone else.
* TODO: Learn to use markdown! There are many introduction and tutorials to markdown.
  Here is one https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo/src/master/
* bitbucket's web interface presents markdown in some fancy ways, including nice formatting of many common programming language. Can you take advantage of this?

## About Not Sharing Unit Materials and Your Work Publically.

You may think that asking you not to share teaching resources online, and not sharing your own work, is restrictive. However, we require this to protect both your work from misuse, as well as to limit issues with teaching materials being shared in an uncontrolled way.
